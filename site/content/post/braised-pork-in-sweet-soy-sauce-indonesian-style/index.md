  Kecap has become a favorite in Indonesia thanks to the unique sweetness of the

5 bay leaves\
4 kaffir lime leaves\
¼ teaspoon ground coriander\

½ teaspoon pepper\
2 star anise petals (1 star anise has several petals, I used 2)\
4 cm cinnamon stick\
1 tablespoon soy sauce\
1 tablespoon oyster sauce\

1 ½ tablespoons Indonesian sweet soy sauce (kecap manis)\
550 ml water\
3 bird’s eye chilies → sliced (adjust to taste)\

**How to make…**

Marinate the pork with salt and lime juice, and let it sit for at least 15 minutes.

Sauté the shallots, garlic, candlenut, ginger, and galangal until fragrant.

Once fragrant, add the lemongrass, bay leaves, kaffir lime leaves, coriander, nutmeg, pepper, star anise, and cinnamon. Stir for a while, then add soy sauce, oyster sauce, and palm sugar, stirring again.

Add the marinated pork, stir well, and cook until a little oil starts to release from the pork.

Next, add the sweet soy sauce, stirring until the dish starts to caramelize slightly. Then, add water and cook until the pork is almost tender.

Add the white tofu, bird’s eye chilies, and large red chilies, stirring well. Cook until the sauce reduces and only a little liquid and oil remain.

Turn off the heat, remove from the pan, and serve.
